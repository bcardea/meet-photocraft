1. Acceptance of the Terms

These Terms & Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Photocraft service ("we," "us," "our"), developed and operated by Beanstalk Management LLC, including our landing page and web application (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, you must discontinue use.

2. Eligibility

You must be at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in your jurisdiction to use the Service. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet this requirement and, if applicable, that you have the authority to bind the entity you represent.

3. Account Registration

To access certain features, you may need to create an account. You agree to:
	• Provide accurate and complete information during registration.
	• Keep your account credentials secure and confidential.
	• Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.

You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account.

4. Use of the Service

a. License Grant: We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and use the Service for your internal business purposes, subject to these Terms.

b. User Conduct: You agree not to:
	• Use the Service for unlawful purposes.
	• Submit false, misleading, or infringing content.
	• Attempt to reverse-engineer, modify, or resell the Service or its underlying technology.
	• Interfere with the security, availability, or operation of the Service.

c. Generated Content: You are responsible for the text prompts you provide. The images we generate are intended for your commercial use, subject to these Terms and applicable laws. You agree not to use generated images in any way that violates laws, infringes upon third-party rights, or causes harm.

5. Image Generation Limits

While we offer "unlimited image generation" as part of our service, we reserve the right to monitor and manage usage to ensure fair access and maintain system integrity. If we determine that your usage exceeds what we consider a normal and reasonable amount for the intended purpose of the Service—defined as generating more than 1,500 images per month—we may throttle your image generation speed, impose additional limitations, or suspend your account temporarily. These measures ensure equitable access for all users.

6. Intellectual Property

a. Our IP: All intellectual property rights in the Service, including but not limited to software, algorithms, designs, and branding, remain our exclusive property or that of our licensors. No ownership rights are transferred to you.

b. Your Content: You retain all rights to content you submit, including text prompts and trademarks you include. By submitting content to the Service, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to process and display that content for the purpose of providing the Service.

7. Payment and Billing

If you subscribe to a paid plan, you agree to pay the fees listed on our pricing page. All payments are due in advance of the subscription period. We reserve the right to change pricing at any time, but will provide advance notice of any changes.

8. Disclaimer of Warranties

The Service is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE." We disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and accuracy. We do not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or meet your requirements.

9. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including lost profits or revenues, arising out of or related to your use of the Service. Our total liability shall not exceed the total fees paid by you in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.

10. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold us, our affiliates, officers, directors, and employees harmless from any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to your use of the Service, your content, or your violation of these Terms.

11. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with or without cause and with or without notice. Upon termination, all licenses granted to you under these Terms will cease. Sections relating to intellectual property, disclaimers, limitation of liability, and indemnification will survive termination.

12. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Virginia, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Virginia, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

13. Changes to the Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by posting the updated Terms with a new "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the Service after any changes constitutes acceptance of those changes.
